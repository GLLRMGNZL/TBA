    dialogueText: 'A child trapped in a cave from which he wants to escape. The owners
      of a shelter that is a prison for thought. Owners who do not own the land but
      believe they do, and by believing it, they become its illegitimate masters.
      But masters nonetheless. They write their own rules, which stem from themselves;
      and what is, exists through them. They are darkness and fear, and they project
      this darkness around them. And the child, who longs to see beyond the darkness
      to glimpse the stars, sees only their light reflected on the Moon.

      Dark
      by nature.'
